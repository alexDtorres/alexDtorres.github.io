You probably shouldn't. 

No, seriously. I mean unless you've dedicated your whole life to studying wheel
physics (a branch of classical mechanics), you're usually going to be costing 
more than you're benefiting. For example, if you have an electric car startup 
then you're not going to hire a whole development team for the tires, or spend 
two years of your valuable time to dabble in the commercial tire R&D game. 
Realistically, you're probably going to go with something like Michelin or 
Firestone because that's kind of their thing, and tires aren't really your 
thing (because electric cars are your thing). 

Great! As long as we all agree on that, we can proceed to the main content.
